# AndroidX-DatabindingAdapters [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novoda/novoda/master/assets/btn_apache_lisence.png)](LICENSE)
Databinding Adapters for AndroidX. It covered the BindingAdapter and BindingMethod with AndroidX views.

## Integration
#### Gradle
```gradle

```

### Notes
Find the BindingAdapter method by [ViewClass]BindingAdapter.<br />
Currently it includes the following classes.
```kotlin
ActionBar
AdapterView
DrawerLayout
NavigationView
ProgressBar
RecyclerView
TabLayout
TextView

```

I will keep adding more methods in this lib.<br />
Feel freee to suggest more binding methods by opening new issues.<br />
