Databinding Adapters for AndroidX. It covered the BindingAdapter and BindingMethod with AndroidX views.

### Integration
#### Gradle
```gradle
implementation "com.sotwtm.androidx:databinding-adapters:0.9.0"
```

### Notes
Find the BindingAdapter method by [ViewClass]BindingAdapter.<br />
Currently it includes the following classes.
```kotlin
ActionBar
AdapterView
DrawerLayout
NavigationView
ProgressBar
RecyclerView
TabLayout
TextView
ViewPager
```

I will keep adding more methods in this lib.<br />
Feel freee to suggest more binding methods by opening new issues.<br />
